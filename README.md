ixat/zat/x4t --whatever you want to call it-- sources

This was released and written a long time ago (December of 2018 or so), months after the project had already abandoned due to a complete loss of interest after 4 years or so of enjoyment.

Contrary to popular belief, this ixat was made and developed in order to learn more about xat and to explore and develop further programming abilities. I would say that more than just that was accomplished in the time it was live.

This includes the:
- Web source
- Server source (python version)
- Client source (flash and html5)

Not included is any of the decompilation tools that may have been used during the process. This goes for the html5 decompilation script, but that can be found [here](https://github.com/austinh115/xat-html5).

They are the versions that were included in the (not-so-)PUBLIC release, so may contain limited, missing, or completely non-existant features that were removed under certain circumstances.

This includes the database ONLY IN REFERENCE, so it is completely NOT working.
For anyone thinking about using this in practical use, you will have to meticulously recreate the database structure on your own with no support anyone who may have been involved.

This is meant to serve as a reference for anybody who may still be interested in learning about the xat protocol specifically or any developments, features, etc. that the ixat team may have extended upon themselves.
Keep in mind that many or all features detailed in these sources may be outdated as they have not been updated in around 2+ years.

Shoutout goes to Skyflare, Daniel, Shadow, Techy, Austin, and any other developers that may have been involved over its lifespan, no matter how long.

Rest in peace, Andy. Thank you for being a great friend and for providing us an environment where we could learn freely.
